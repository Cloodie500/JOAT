Literally the best exploit. This sh*t bypasses every single extension restrictor there is. EVERY SINGLE ONE.

So here's how to use it. First, go to chrome://chrome-signin . Then, type in google@d11.org in the email address part. Click Enter. Now, scroll down and click on "Sign-in options". Choose "Sign-in with Github". Now scroll down for the second time and click on "Docs". This should take you to a github page. Now go ALL the way down and find "Ask the Github community" After clicking on that, you should enter Github. Go to search and search up my user: "Cloodie500". The go to my urlsigma repository and click on the link there. Now, you have unrestricted access to the entirety of the internet ðŸ’€
This works by exploiting the GitHub sign-in method and it works because while you can browse the internet with no restrictions wahtsoever, Google still thinks that you're trying to sign-in, so this won't even show up on your search history, except for chrome://chrome-signin but who cares no one ain't gonna suspect sh*t bruh


Also I wrote this on Github because I know thousands of kids search Github for exploits to bypass restrictionsðŸ—¿
